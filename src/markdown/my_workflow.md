# My VSCode Workflow: Tips & Tricks for Developers

Optimizing your coding environment can make a huge difference in productivity and focus. Over time, I’ve picked up a few tricks in VSCode that not only speed up my work but also make coding more enjoyable. In this post, I’ll share my favorite tips, including quick file creation, customizing the interface to minimize distractions and leveraging Vim for efficient keyboard navigation.

## Quick File Creation with Advanced New File

One of my favorite productivity hacks is using the **Advanced New File** plugin. This tool allows me to create files instantly from anywhere in VSCode with a simple keyboard shortcut—**Cmd + Opt + N** on macOS and **Ctrl + Alt + N** on Windows. Once triggered, I just type the folder name, press Enter to confirm, and then enter the filename. If I need to create a file inside a new folder, I can simply type "folder/newFile.md"—the folder will be created automatically if it doesn’t already exist.

## Minimize Distractions in VSCode

A clean workspace helps me concentrate on the code rather than being distracted by too many visual elements. I`ve customized my VSCode interface by:

- **Hiding the Activity Bar**: This removes unnecessary icons.
- **Closing the Primary Sidebar**: I rarely need to see the file tree, and i can toggle it with Cmd+B(or Ctrl+B) whenever required.
- **Removing Breadcrumbs and Minimaps**: With these elements hidden, my screen stays clean and distraction-free.

When I need to find a file, I simply press Cmd + P (or Ctrl + P on Windows) to open the Quick Open menu and start typing the filename. This approach allows me to navigate my projects efficiently without distractions.

## VSCode Vim for efficient keyboard navigation

Another game-changer in my workflow is the **Vim extension** (by vscodevim). This extension lets me navigate and edit files using only the keyboard, eliminating the need for a mouse. The familiar Vim keybindings make moving around the file and performing edits incredibly fast—and it’s fun too! If you’re curious about how it works, I am going to write a separate post detailing its benefits and setup. It’s a fantastic way to boost productivity once you get used to it.
