## The basics of VIM

The difference between the structure of VIM and what you are used to in an editor like VSCode is that in default mode in VSCode you are always in insert mode. There really isnt any mode in VSCode, you are always in the mode where if you press h you will type h. But by using VIM plugin, you will have different modes. The default mode in VIM is -- NORMAL -- mode, which is the way you navigate around the text.
